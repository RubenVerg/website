QuickLink, at [quicklink.rubenverg.com](https://quicklink.rubenverg.com)
## Usage
**QuickLink** was created on my Neocities site, used as a faster alternative to long links in places, such as Gamepedia, where bit.ly's are forbidden due to potential NSFW content.
The usage is simple, go to [quicklink.rubenverg.com?id=<id>](https://quicklink.rubenverg.com/?id=-1), where id is one of the following:
  |ID|Link you are sent to|

  |2|t.me/scala_network|
