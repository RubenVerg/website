  Until a few years ago, everyone was sure Australia existed. But one day in 2014, a girl from Australia posted on
  Facebook a conspiracy theory she "made up while laying in bed," according to which the country she lives in doesn't
  exist.

<p>
  Instead, it was invented by United Kingdom officials to have a simple way to kill all criminals while still appearing
  to the rest of Europe as a modern country, where death penalty is not common. Therefore, they decided to invent an
  island in a place where few people have been, and sent a lot of murderers there.

  A lot of people that live in Australia take this theory as a big joke. A newspaper from this country, instead, decided
  to flip the theory: according to them, Australia is the only country in the world!
</p>

  We are told that Australia is a big island, but in the middle there's only a desert. That's why no one wants to visit
  it. According to the newspaper, the desert contains actors that pretend to be from other countries!
</p>
<p>
  Of course, that's not what Australia actually is!
